## Purchase Non-Consumable

Non-Consumable items are my favorite! They can only ever be purchased once and if the user tries to purchase them again it will just restore them automatically. This is great when you have something that you never want to charge for again such as unlocking a game level or removing ads.

Each app store calls them something slightly different:
* Apple: Non-Consumable
* Android: Managed Product
* Microsoft: Durable with Lifetime

All purchases go through the `PurchaseAsync` method and you must always `ConnectAsync` before making calls and `DisconnectAsync` after making calls:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Purchase a specific product or subscription
/// </summary>
/// <param name="productId">Sku or ID of product</param>
/// <param name="itemType">Type of product being requested</param>
/// <param name="verifyPurchase">Verify Purchase implementation</param>
/// <returns>Purchase details</returns>
/// <exception cref="InAppBillingPurchaseException">If an error occures during processing</exception>
Task<InAppBillingPurchase> PurchaseAsync(string productId, ItemType itemType, IInAppBillingVerifyPurchase verifyPurchase = null);
```

On Android you must call `FinalizePurchaseAsync` within 3 days when a purchase is validated. Please read the [Android documentation on Pending Transactions](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/integrate#pending) for more information.

On iOS you must also call 

Example:
```csharp
public async Task<bool> PurchaseItem(string productId)
{
    var billing = CrossInAppBilling.Current;
    try
    {
        var connected = await billing.ConnectAsync();
        if (!connected)
        {
            //we are offline or can't connect, don't try to purchase
            return false;
        }

        //check purchases
        var purchase = await billing.PurchaseAsync(productId, ItemType.InAppPurchase, payload);

        //possibility that a null came through.
        if(purchase == null)
        {
            //did not purchase
        }
        else if(purchase.State == PurchaseState.Purchased)
        {              
             var ack = await CrossInAppBilling.Current.FinalizePurchaseAsync(purchase.TransactionIdentifier);

             // Handle if acknowledge was successful or not
        }
    }
    catch (InAppBillingPurchaseException purchaseEx)
    {
        //Billing Exception handle this based on the type
        Debug.WriteLine("Error: " + purchaseEx);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        //Something else has gone wrong, log it
        Debug.WriteLine("Issue connecting: " + ex);
    }
    finally
    {
        await billing.DisconnectAsync();
    }
```
